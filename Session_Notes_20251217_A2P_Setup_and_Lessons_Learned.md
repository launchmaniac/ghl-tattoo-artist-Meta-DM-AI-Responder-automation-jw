# Session Notes - December 17, 2025 (Part 2)
**Focus:** A2P Registration Setup + Domain Purchase + Lessons Learned Documentation

---

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. Privacy Policy + Terms of Service Template Creation
**Task:** 2.1b (86dyxd7hr)
**Time Logged:** 32 minutes
**Status:** Complete

**What Was Built:**
- Privacy Policy page template (Launch Maniac Agency OS)
- Terms of Service page template (Launch Maniac Agency OS)
- Both include SMS-specific consent language
- Templates use custom values/variables for reusability

**Why Built:**
A2P registration for sole proprietor requires both Privacy Policy AND Terms of Service accessible from SMS opt-in form. Previously thought individual verification was via face scan only, but GHL A2P for sole proprietor needs full compliance documentation.

---

### 2. Privacy/ToS Snapshot Push to Tony's Account
**Task:** 2.1c (86dyxd7u1)
**Time Logged:** 20 minutes
**Status:** Complete

**What Was Done:**
- Created snapshot of Privacy Policy + Terms of Service pages
- Pushed snapshot to Tony's sub-account
- Discovered domain requirement (documented below)
- Purchased domain: TonyRazTattoo.com ($13)

---

### 3. Domain Purchase for A2P Funnel Pages
**Discovery:** No free GHL subdomain option exists without purchasing root domain

**Action Taken:**
- Purchased TonyRazTattoo.com via GHL
- Cost: $13 (customer-facing price: $15)
- Location: Site → Client Portal → Domains

**Lesson Learned:**
- Every client sub-account needs domain purchase for A2P funnel pages
- No free workaround exists
- Ask clients upfront: Do you have a domain? (saves $15 if yes)
- Factor into pricing: $40 upfront (A2P $25 + Domain $15)

---

### 4. A2P Registration Completion
**Tasks:** 2.3 (86dyw23gp) + 2.4 (86dyw23k8)
**Status:** Complete and Submitted

**What Was Completed:**
- Filled out A2P registration form (sole proprietor)
- Used new client form with Privacy Policy + Terms of Service links
- Submitted application
- Received identity verification link for Tony (face scan + ID photo)

**Updated Discovery:**
Sole proprietor A2P DOES have identity verification via face scan + ID photo, but it happens AFTER form submission via client link (not during initial form).

**A2P Messaging Templates:**
Documented in Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FItAQ6nWEIGGVPukbHmhHxb3sBts6CmSwLe-SJ4EI7c/edit?tab=t.r1j1ijk7obw5

---

### 5. Conversational AI Adjustments (In Progress)
**Task:** 86dyw26eg (Instagram workflow)
**Status:** In Progress (paused for Instagram connection)

**Issue Identified:**
When asked "What do I need to do to book with Tony?", AI responded with "What size are you thinking?" instead of recognizing booking intent.

**Proposed Fix:**
Shift from "bot interrogation" to "natural receptionist" approach:
- Ask what they want first (not size/placement)
- Check timeline (March booking month)
- Natural handoff: "Tony will message you to set it up"
- Feels less robotic, more conversational

**Status:** User working on prompt adjustments, not finalized yet

---

## 🔄 Current Status (Mid-Session Pause)

**✅ COMPLETE:**
- Privacy Policy + Terms of Service templates (52 min total)
- Domain purchased (TonyRazTattoo.com)
- A2P registration submitted
- Waiting for A2P approval (3-7 days)

**🟡 IN PROGRESS:**
- Connecting Instagram to test DM workflow
- Conversational AI adjustments (paused)

**🔴 BLOCKED:**
- SMS testing (waiting for A2P approval)
- Phone number purchase (waiting for A2P approval)

---

## 🔗 Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned

### 1. Domain Purchase is Mandatory for A2P Funnel Pages
**Problem:** A2P funnel pages wouldn't go live after snapshot push

**Root Cause:** GHL requires domain/subdomain setup for funnel pages

**Discovery from GHL Support:** No free GHL subdomain exists without purchasing root domain

**Solution:**
- Purchase domain via GHL (~$15/year) OR
- Connect client's existing domain (free if they have one)
- Location: Site → Client Portal → Domains (non-intuitive, hard to find)

**Cost Impact:**
- Domain: $13 actual ($15 customer-facing)
- A2P Application: $25
- **Total Upfront:** $40 per client setup

**For Future Projects:**
- Ask client: Do you have a domain? (saves $15)
- Purchase domain FIRST before building funnel pages
- Include $40 upfront in onboarding pricing

### 2. A2P Sole Proprietor Identity Verification Process
**Updated Understanding:**
Sole proprietor A2P DOES include identity verification (face scan + ID photo), but it's a separate step AFTER form submission.

**Process:**
1. Complete A2P form (requires Privacy Policy + Terms of Service)
2. Submit application
3. GHL provides identity verification link
4. Send link to client
5. Client completes:
   - Photo of government-issued ID
   - Face scan verification
6. Wait for approval (3-7 days)

**Requirements:**
- Privacy Policy page (SMS consent language)
- Terms of Service page
- Domain for funnel pages
- Client cooperation for identity verification

**Templates:**
A2P messaging for sole proprietor AND business documented in:

### 3. Conversational AI Natural Handoff Challenge
**Problem:** AI responses feel robotic, customers don't like talking to bots

**Identified Issues:**
- Jumps straight to qualifying questions ("What size?")
- No natural conversation flow
- Doesn't recognize booking intent variations

**Proposed Solution:**
Shift to "receptionist assistant" approach:
- Ask what they want (natural starting point)
- Check if timeline works (March booking)
- Natural transition: "Tony will message you"
- Less interrogative, more conversational

**Status:** User adjusting prompts, testing in progress
