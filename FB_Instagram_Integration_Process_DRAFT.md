# Facebook/Instagram Integration Process for GHL
**Status:** DRAFT - Will be updated after Tony's account connection (Dec 17, 2025)

## Discovery: Meta Business Suite Linking is NOT Enough

### What DOESN'T Work for GHL Integration:
❌ Meta Business Suite → Settings → Accounts → Instagram accounts → Add Instagram

**Why:** This adds Instagram to Business Suite but doesn't create the proper page-level connection that GHL requires.

---

## What DOES Work:

### Step 1: Add Instagram as Connected Asset to Facebook Page
1. Go to **Meta Business Suite**
2. Navigate to: **Settings → Accounts → Pages**
3. Select your **Pro Facebook Page**
4. Click **Connected Assets**
5. **Add Pro Instagram Page**

### Step 2: Connect to GHL
1. GHL → Settings → Integrations → FB/Instagram Integration
2. Click "Connect"
3. Select your Facebook Page
4. Both Facebook Messenger + Instagram DM options should appear

## UNCLEAR: Personal FB Page Requirement

**Question:** Is it required to create a separate page in the personal Facebook account (that manages both professional accounts) BEFORE linking in Meta Business Suite?

**Current Process Used:**
1. Personal FB account (Whitbeck Jake) manages both LM Instagram + LM Facebook
2. Created new Facebook Page in personal account
3. Added page to Meta Business Suite
4. Then followed Connected Assets process above

**To Be Confirmed:** Can you skip creating the page in personal FB and go straight to Meta Business Suite?

**Will update this note after connecting Tony's accounts to determine exact required steps.**

## Technical Details

**What We Know:**
- Instagram must be "Connected Asset" of Facebook Page (not just in Business Suite)
- GHL requires page-level connection to access both Messenger + Instagram DMs
- Meta Business Suite account management ≠ Page-level asset connection

**What We Need to Confirm:**
- Exact sequence of steps (personal FB page creation vs. direct Business Suite setup)
- Whether shared experiences in Meta Business Suite matters
- Minimum permissions needed

---

## Next Steps

**When connecting Tony's accounts:**
1. Document exact step-by-step process
2. Confirm if personal FB page creation is required
3. Update this document with final validated process
4. Add to onboarding checklist for future clients
